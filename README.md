# Competitive-Programming-data-generator

Seeing the awkward situation happened in the 2023 ICPC Asia Xiaan Regional Contest, The author wrote this.  
This project aimed at making a useful generator that can safely used in Competitive Programming(ICPC, etc.), and hoping everyone provide his generator to this project to better it.
Meanwhile, considering the fame of the author, this might be a personal project for ever.

## Usage
This project is based on Testlib which is created by MikeMirzayanov. So, anyone who use this generator should put '[testlib.h](https://github.com/MikeMirzayanov/testlib)' in the same directory with 'generator.h'.  

The Docs is being writing. However, the comments of this code is enough to let its user know what every function is doing. Have fun using this.
