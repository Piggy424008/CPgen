.SH "Quick Start"
.PP
Seeing the awkward situation happened in the 2023 ICPC Asia Xiaan Regional Contest, The author wrote this\&. 
.br
.PP
CPgen stands for Competitive Programming Data Generator\&.It is a project aimed to be a useful generator that can safely and conveniently used in Competitive Programming(OI, ICPC, etc\&.)\&. 
.br
.PP
CPgen is hoped to be a library that help problem makers to save their time on data-making\&.
.PP
Here is an example of a generator using CPgen: 
.PP
.nf
#include "\&.\&./generator/generator\&.h"

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    registerGen(argc, argv, 1);
    int n = rnd\&.next(1, 1000), m = rnd\&.next(1, 1000);
    println(n, m);
    Array<int> arr; arr\&.basic_gen(m, 1, 10 * sqrt(n))\&.print();
}

.fi
.PP
 This example generates an array with size of $m$, whose elements are integers from $1$ to $10\sqrt{n}$, and print $n, m$ and the array to the standard output\&.
.PP
You should note that CPgen is based on testlib\&. So you are required to have \fRtestlib\&.h\fP in your working directory (or in your environment path)\&.
.PP
To get the latest version of CPgen, download its source code via \fRrepo\fP\&.
.SH "Usages"
.PP
When looking through the docs of CPgen, you should note that the first place in std::vector is ignored by CPgen\&. That's to say, every vector used in CPgen is 1-indexed\&. And, \fRstd::vector<_Tp>()\&.size()\fP means \fR*this\&.size() - 1\fP in the implement\&.
.PP
Read Docs for further information\&.
.SH "FAQs"
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
I generate exactly the same data while I run it many times\&. Why is that? 
.br

.PP
.PP
It indeed testlib fault\&. To ensure the generator can generator exactly the same data somehow, the seed of rnd(the RNG of testlib) is calculated by the command you type when you ran it\&. Try to run it with different args\&. For example, try: 
.PP
.nf
>>> \&./foo CPgen
>>> \&./foo Piggy424008
>>> \&./foo cplusplus

.fi
.PP
 Then it's expected to generate some different data\&.
